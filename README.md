# calculatorWithJS

[Click here to see the project](https://mehmetcakir1.github.io/calculatorWithJS/)

In this project; <br>
- I made a calculator like IOS Calculator <br>
- I used capturing method in order to access each button's innerText <br>
- I used Switch Statement in the function. <br>
- I divided the container two parts: <br>
    *One of them is the screen part where the result is displayed <br>
    *The other part is the div containing buttons <br>
- You can calculate basic Math operations with this calcuator. <br>
- You can sum,subtract,divide and multiply the numbers. <br>
- When calculation is done and pressing "=" button, the result will be shown in the display unit which is above the buttons<br>
- You can calculate the percentage of the numbers pressing "%" button.<br>
- You can not press “.” button if the number in the screen already includes period.<br>
- You can not press "+,-,*,/" buttons if the numbers in the screen ends with period.<br>
- You can not press operation sign buttons if there is no number in the screen.<br>
- You can not press operation sign buttons in a row.<br>
- You can change the sign of the number clicking "±".<br>
- This project has not been done yet.I will add more complicated features in the near future.<br>
